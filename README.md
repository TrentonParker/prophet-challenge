# prophet-challenge

**This is my repository for the Module 8 Challenge, 'prophet-challenge'. This honestly went very smooth for me and I was able to slice and manipulate the data and visualize different aspects of it. The data is a lot easier to draw conclusions from once it is plotted in some form, and I can see that manipulating data and plotting forecasts using Prophet has a wide variety of uses on all types of data.**
